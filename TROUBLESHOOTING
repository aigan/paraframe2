MIXING PARAFRAME WITH OTHER STUFF

For turning of Paraframe in a subdirectory, you may want to place a
"PerlSetVar site ignore" in the .htaccess in the root directory of the
other program.

You may also have to negate the directory handling code by using the
fixup handler by adding "PerlFixupHandler Para::Frame::Client::Fixup"
in the .htaccess

  PerlSetVar site ignore
  PerlFixupHandler Para::Frame::Client::Fixup
