NAME
    Para::Frame - Web site framework and application server


DESCRIPTION
    Para::Frame is a system to use for dynamic web sites. It runs as a
    backend daemon taking page requests from a Apache mod_perl client
    and returns a HTTP response.

    

    This system differs from other alternatives. Try it out and see if
    it matches your way of thinking.

    The URL paths represents information you want to GET. Each type of
    information has it's own tempalte file and the URL path directs
    you to that template.  If you want to SET data, you use 'actions'
    in form of separate Perl modules

it's done in 'actions'
    that are completely separate from 



    It aims for making life simple, with defaults for everything. But
    it is a collection of a lot of things that could be useful in
    creating a dynamic web site.

    This framework uses the Template Toolkit for building pages.

    

    There is a lot of web site framework and application server


    Wraf implements a RDF API that hopes to realize the Semantic
    Web. The framework uses RDF for data, user interface, modules and
    object methods. It uses interfaces to other sources in order to
    integrate all data in one enviroment, regardless of storage form.


DOCUMENTATION
    The documentation is far from complete and not up to date.  Send
    any question to the mailinglist rdf@uxn.nu.  Look for comments in
    the source and notes in the ./doc directory.


PREREQUISITIES
    Perl v5.6 with modules Template v2, Time::Hires, CGI, FreezeThaw, DBI,
    DBD::Pg and URI.  PostgreSQL.  Apache v1.3 with mod_usertrack.


INSTALL
    The test program bin/serv1.pl will look for the libraries in
    ../lib (relative to the current directory).  Create the databases
    wraf_v01a in PostgreSQL and initiate it with the tables in
    doc/rdf.sql  Do not 'make install'.  See doc/INSTALL for details.


TEST EXAMPLE
    Make the CGI program cgi-bin/client.cgi executable from a webserver.
    Start ./serv1.pl in bin and be amazed at the amount of work needed
    for a simple stupid list of names.  Use cgi-bin/demo.html as a
    starting point.
