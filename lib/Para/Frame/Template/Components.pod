=head1 NAME

Para::Frame::Template::Components - Common template macro widgets

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These macros are defined in C<inc/html/c/components.tt> and can be
replaced by a custom implementation by a file with the same name in
your TT path.

Widgets can be implemented either as exported objects (functions /
methods / variables) or as templates for inclusion or defined template
macros.

These are the standard widgets defined as TT macros.  See also the
standard L<Para::Frame::Widget> module.

The select field has the name $field.  @data is the list of records
returned from select_list().  $valkey is the field name holding the
values and $tagkey is the field holding the lables used in the
dropdown.  $current is the current value used for determining which
item to select.

If $header is defiend, it's a label first in the list without a value.

values, sorted on the keys. $current value will be selected.  $field
is the name of fhe field.
